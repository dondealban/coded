# Continuous Degradation Detection (CODED)

CODED is an algorithm developed to monitor for low-magnitude forest disturbances using Landsat data. The algorithm is based upon previous developments in continuous land cover monitoring [(Zhu and Woodcock, 2014)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425714000248) and tropical degradation monitoring using spectral unmixing models [(Souza et al., 2013)](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/5/11/5493/html) and is built upon the [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) processing and data storage system. CODED is designed to create a stratification for sample-based estimation of degraded forests. 

An updated repository with Javascript code to run the algorithm can be found [here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/bullocke/coded).
