========================================

This is the documentation for the Continuous Degradation Detection (CODED) algorithm. CODED is open source and can run on the `Google Earth Engine`_. CODED can be used to monitor and estimate forest degradation and deforestation.

This documentation and the CODED algorithm are still very much a work in progress. For any questions please contact me at: bullocke@bu.edu.
